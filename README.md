## Inspiration

### 1. Bruno Simon's Portfolio Page
 - Amazed at what can be accomplished with the use of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
 - Creativity and thinking outside the box (though not accessible)

### 2. Dark / Light Theme
 - Insightful article on improving UX, which I look to implement in future projects.
 - Takes into consideration the user's preference, and loads that theme on default.

## Focus
 - I would love to have the opportunity on getting exposure to larger-scale projects for:
    - Project Architecture
    - Code Organization
    - Pull Request Process
    - Testing
 - Learning best practices, and additional tooling
